Dresden Files RPG Character HTML5 Character Sheet
================

An HTML5 Web app for making a Dresden RPG character sheet.

It is designed to be filled out in a browser and then printed.  No web server is required - you can download this repo as a .zip and run it locally on your compter.  It should consistently print to 2 pages (although I have been trying to get rid of a nusance blank third page).

There's a small amount of logic built into the sheet to make it easier, such as counting skill slots purchased, changing max stress, flowing some power level data to the sheet, and that kind of thing.

This work is _heavily_ inspired by the official character sheets, but is not identical (both as an ease-of-use and ease-of-build matter).  Anyone can use it as they please for personal use.  If you would like to fork the project to improve my code or use it for a different RPG, I have placed the work under a fairly open creative commons license.
